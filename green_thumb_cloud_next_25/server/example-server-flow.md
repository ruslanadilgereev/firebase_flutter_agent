Notice the lack of a "ref" property on the "toolResponse". Gemini doesn't
provide a "ref" as of 2025-03-05, but it should in the future. If the ref is
provided in the source `toolResponse`, make sure to include it in the response.

It's perfect for preparing new garden beds or revitalizing existing ones. Simply mix it into the top layer of soil before planting to create an ideal environment for flowers to thrive.\n\n**Product 2:** These granular plant food spikes provide a slow-release source of nutrients for flowering plants. They are easy to use - simply insert them into the soil around your existing plants, and they will gradually release nutrients over an extended period, promoting vibrant blooms and strong growth. They're especially beneficial for areas with full sun exposure, as they help plants maintain consistent access to the resources they need.\n"
